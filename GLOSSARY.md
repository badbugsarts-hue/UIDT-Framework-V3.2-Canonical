# 📖 UIDT Glossary & Definitions

A reference guide to the terminology used in the Unified Information-Density Theory (v3.5.6).

## A-M
* **Canonical Parameters:** The set of values ($\Delta, \gamma, \kappa$) derived strictly from the 3-Equation System without external fitting.
* **Deep Well:** The global stability minimum in the scalar potential $V(S)$ where the universe resides. Visualized in Figure 3.
* **Gamma Invariant ($\gamma$):** The fundamental scaling factor ($\approx 16.339$) connecting quantum scales to cosmological scales.
* **Holographic Scale ($\lambda_{UIDT}$):** The smallest unit of geometric information density, calculated as $0.66$ nm in v3.5.6.

## N-Z
* **99-Step RG Cascade:** The hierarchical renormalization group flow that steps down the vacuum energy density by $\gamma^{-12}$, solving the Cosmological Constant Problem.
* **Pillar I (QFT):** The microscopic foundation of the theory, anchored by the Yang-Mills Mass Gap.
* **Pillar II (Cosmology):** The macroscopic application, resolving the Hubble Tension and Dark Energy.
* **SMDS (Supermassive Dark Seeds):** Primordial concentrations of information density that act as seeds for early galaxy formation (JWST target).
* **Three-Equation System:** The coupled non-linear system (Vacuum Stability, Schwinger-Dyson, Fixed Point) that solves the theory.
